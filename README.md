# osurender
An osu! replay parsing rendering script that outputs to mp4.
Currently extremely WIP. Plans are to have the rendered mp4 look as if it were recorded in the official client.
Eventually at least.

# Setup
Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the directory after cloning this repo
Also install [pyoppai](https://github.com/francesco149/oppai)

# Usage
Usage is as follows:
```python render.py replay_name.osr```
It gives the percentage of completion and how long it's been rendering the replay.
