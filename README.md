# osurender (was osureplay, but I want it to be used for maps in general as well.)
An osu! map rendering script that outputs to mp4.
Currently extremely WIP. Plans are to have the rendered mp4 look as if it were recorded in the official client.
Eventually at least.

# Setup
The only thing you need to do is make sure you have PIL installed, pillow if you're using python 3+

# Usage
Usage is as follows:
```python render.py filename.osu```
It outputs it's progress so you have an idea of how long you'll be waiting :D
