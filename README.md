# osurender
An osu! replay parsing rendering script that outputs to mp4.
Currently extremely WIP. Plans are to have the rendered mp4 look as if it were recorded in the official client.
Eventually at least.

# Setup
Make sure you have matplotlib and [pyoppai](https://github.com/francesco149/oppai)

# Usage
Usage plans to be as follows:
```python render.py replay_name.osr```
It gives the percentage of completion and how long it's been rendering the replay.
However:
```python render.py name```
is what it needs currently, name being the shared name of the .osu and .osr (example.osu example.osr)

# Example
